# Cloud-Workload-Prediction
## Predicting Cloud workload using Transformer models

Cloud Systems have become very prominent in recent years. Since the inception
of the internet, as more and more people regularly use the internet, server size has
increased exponentially. Many applications and protocols need cloud servers to
function. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns forced many
people into their houses. This resulted in many businesses and companies enact work from home policies. This, in turn, increased demand for online video
conference applications, online programming terminals, online business analytic
discussion programs, and many more.


All of these require quick and efficient cloud servers. This rise in demand for
companies like video conference have met collaborative cloud services applications
like Zoom, Google meet, Webex by Cisco, and Microsoft teams. Collaborative
coding websites like Google Colaboratory. Collaborative document writing with
the help of google docs. These collaborative cloud services have seen unprecedented growth during the pandemic.


The pandemic has shown that a lot of jobs can be done from home. Despite
the end of the pandemic, many companies have decided to continue their work
from home policies. This is due to the fact that working from home can help
both the employer and the employee. The employer does not need to rent office
space . Therefore, they can improve their margins. Whereas the employees may
prefer to work from the comfort of their homes and would prefer not to waste time in unnecessary commuting. Therefore, as this trend of decentralized working
continues, the demand for collaborative cloud services will keep increasing.


With the number of users coming onto the cloud systems increasing, we need
a flexible and dynamic cloud. A dynamic cloud alters the number of resources
and automatically regulates and adjusts itself as the cloud workload changes.
Therefore we need an efficient workload prediction algorithm.
